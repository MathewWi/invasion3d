Dear old-school gamer,

I hope you have as much fun playing this game as I had writing it. I wrote
this game during April and May of 2005 while living in Almetyevsk, Russia.
If you assumed that I was bored, you would be right. ;)

This game was inspired by the original Taito Space Invaders from 1978, and
is dedicated to the MAME team (http://www.mame.net). Through their great
effort and generosity, it's possible to play these great old arcade games
which would otherwise be lost to memory.

I originally had the idea to write Invasion 3D during the summer of 2004,
when I was living in New Jersey. I was playing the original Space Invaders
on MAME, and was amazed at how good the gameplay is, but frustrated because
I could only shoot one bullet at a time! So I decided to write a modern 3-D
accelerated Space Invaders game which would allow for as many bullets as I
could shoot, and massive alien carnage.

Thusly was Invasion 3D born. Originally I thought to use my Jax3D engine
to make the graphics, but I later decided to learn something new and write
this game with OpenGL. Since I appreciate the value of free software, I also
decided to use the open source SDL library and make this game portable across
operating systems, and as a result there are two versions of this game - one
for Windows and one for Linux.
